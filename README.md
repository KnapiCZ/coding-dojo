# ⛩️ My Coding Dojo

Central hub for my projects, experiments, and code snippets. Some are production-ready, others are training dummies for my code katas.

## 🚀 Production & Client Work
**Real-world solutions currently in use.**
These projects solve actual business problems and run in production environments.

### [Saunadomek Rakovec](https://saunadomekrakovec.cz/)
**Wellness reservation system & Coupon management.**
Built on WordPress to allow easy content management for the client, but heavily customized to handle specific booking logic.
* **Stack:** WordPress (Customized), PHP, CSS
* **The mission:** A robust reservation system with a custom coupon module.

### ATKa (Internal Tool)
**Warehouse & Order Management System.**
Mobile app for digitalizing inventory workflow. Since warehouses often have poor signal, I designed it to work fully offline.
* **Stack:** FlutterFlow, Flutter, Firebase, SQLite (Local DB)
* **The heavy lifting:** Implemented an **offline-first architecture**—data is stored locally in SQL and syncs with Firebase automatically when the connection is restored.

### [M+M Semonice](https://mmsemonice.cz/)
**Information portal for Social Services (SASRD).**
Focus on accessibility and clarity for a non-profit organization.
* **Stack:** WordPress
* **Focus:** Informative structure and ease of use for the client.

## 🧪 Engineering Labs & Academics
**From complex systems to simple experiments.**
A diverse collection of projects built for educational purposes and personal growth. Ranges from **technically challenging engineering** (like compilers) to **simple design practice** and frontend explorations.

### [GymSpace](https://gymspace.cz) (to be added)
**Fitness Platform Prototype.**
Originally a school team project evolved into a personal full-stack showcase. GymSpace goes beyond standard workout tracking—it builds local communities and lets gyms battle for dominance in fitness challenges.
* **Stack:** VueJS, Django REST
* **The Challenge:** Complex relation handling between users, gyms, divisions and challenges.

### Compiler IFJ
**Easy compiler IFJ25 Compiler**
Compiler that handles compiling from IFJ25(Wren like language) to IFJ25Code(assembly like language)**
* **Stack:** C
* **Focus:** Understanding how compilers work and how to create one from language description

### [Johny Depp Website](https://johnny-depp-vut.netlify.app/)
**Simple website about person**
Clean and working website featuring johny depps work and blah blah
* **Stack:** HTML, CSS, JS
* **Focus:** Practise basics and learn how to use grid and row and column

## 🥋 The Dojo (Snippets & Katas)
Where I practice and break things.

* 📂 **/projects** – Full-scale applications and extracted modules. A mix of complete builds and specific subsystems (like complex logic from client work).
* 📂 **/algorithms** – My solutions to coding challenges (mostly C & Python).
* 📂 **/components** – Isolated VueJS UI components I reuse across projects.
* 📂 **/scripts** – Random automation tools I can't live without.

## 🎒 Inventory (Tech Stack)
**Main:** VueJS, TypeScript, Python (Django),

**Others:** FlutterFlow, Flutter, C

**Tools:** Docker(TODO), Git, Linux
